A “Plane Accidents” web application centralizes aviation incident data to help investigators, airlines, and the public understand what happened, why it happened, and how to prevent it next time. It ingests reports from official sources and crowd-verified tips, enriches them with aircraft, route, and weather metadata, and visualizes events on an interactive map and timeline. Users can filter by airline, aircraft type, phase of flight, or causal factors, then dive into case pages with summaries, evidence, and corrective actions. Built-in analytics surface recurring risk patterns (e.g., runway excursions in low visibility), while alerting keeps stakeholders updated on new or similar incidents. Role-based access protects sensitive details, audit trails support compliance, and post-incident workflows track recommendations through closure—turning raw reports into actionable safety improvements.
